1. Download GitHub repository with the assignment https://github.com/pavponn/machine-learning-gatech/tree/master/assignment-2.
2. Open folder assignment-1 locally. 
3. Ensure that you install all requirements from requirements.txt
4. Code that generates data for later visualization for RO problems is in one_max.py flip_flop.py, and n_queens.py files. Run them to simulate creation of outputs/ folder.
5. To recreate all visualisation/plots for discrete RO problems, run python notebooks one_max_plots.ipynb flip_flop_plots.ipynb, and n_queens_plots.ipynb
5. To recreate everything for NN analysis, please, use nn_analysis.ipynb file. Dataset is already in the repository.
